        <h2>What is a Sheriff Sale in New Jersey?</h2>
        <p>
          In New Jersey, most foreclosures go through the courts. After a lender gets a final judgment of foreclosure, the court can direct the
          county sheriff to schedule a public auction — called a <strong>sheriff sale</strong>. At that sale, the property may be sold to the
          highest bidder, which can be the bank or a third-party buyer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Getting notice of a sheriff sale does <em>not</em> mean everything is over, but it does mean time is short. The sooner you act,
          the more options you typically have.
        </p>

        <h2>Where Are You in the Foreclosure Timeline?</h2>
        <p>Very broadly, New Jersey homeowners tend to be in one of these stages:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Pre-foreclosure</strong> – Behind on payments, receiving warning letters or a Notice of Intent to Foreclose.</li>
          <li><strong>Lis pendens &amp; complaint</strong> – The lender files a foreclosure lawsuit and records a lis pendens.</li>
          <li><strong>Judgment entered</strong> – The court enters a judgment of foreclosure in favor of the lender.</li>
          <li><strong>Sheriff sale scheduled</strong> – The county sheriff sets an auction date and sends you notice.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Your options will look different depending on which stage you’re in. Even with a sheriff sale date, you may still have ways to delay,
          avoid, or better manage what happens next.
        </p>

        <h2>Option 1: Ask About Loss-Mitigation with Your Lender</h2>
        <p>
          In many cases, it’s still worth asking the lender or servicer about “loss-mitigation” options — even if a sheriff sale is already on the calendar.
          These may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Loan modification</strong> – Changing the terms of your mortgage to make payments more affordable.</li>
          <li><strong>Repayment plan</strong> – Spreading missed payments over future months.</li>
          <li><strong>Forbearance</strong> – A short-term pause or reduction in payments.</li>
          <li><strong>Short sale</strong> – Selling the property, sometimes for less than the balance owed, with lender approval.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          None of these are guaranteed, and they often take time to review — but if your sale date is weeks or months away, asking about these options
          can sometimes lead to a pause or change in the timeline.
        </p>

        <h2>Option 2: Request an Adjournment of the Sheriff Sale</h2>
        <p>
          New Jersey homeowners may be able to request limited adjournments of their sheriff sale. This is essentially a postponement of the sale date.
          Exact rules can depend on the county and current law, but many counties allow:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A certain number of adjournments (for example, two), and</li>
          <li>A set number of days per adjournment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          An adjournment does <em>not</em> erase the foreclosure. What it can do is buy you time to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Explore a sale of the home on better terms,</li>
          <li>Apply for loss-mitigation, or</li>
          <li>Get professional guidance on your next steps.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Option 3: Sell Before the Sheriff Sale</h2>
        <p>
          For some homeowners, selling before the sheriff sale is a way to avoid the public auction, protect equity, and have more control over timing.
          Depending on your situation, this might look like:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Traditional sale</strong> – Listing with a real estate agent if you have time and equity.</li>
          <li><strong>Short sale</strong> – Working with your lender to accept a sale price that may be less than what you owe.</li>
          <li><strong>Investor or cash buyer</strong> – Selling quickly to avoid the sale and move on with less stress.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          No option is “one size fits all.” What makes sense depends on your equity, condition of the home, and your goals — staying vs. leaving on your own terms.
        </p>

        <h2>Option 4: Talk to a Professional About Legal Tools</h2>
        <p>
          Some homeowners speak with attorneys about legal options that may affect a sheriff sale, including bankruptcy or foreclosure defense strategies.
          These tools can have serious consequences and benefits that are far beyond the scope of a simple article.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are considering any legal action, it’s important to speak with a qualified attorney or housing counselor who understands New Jersey law.
          What worked for someone else may not be right for you.
        </p>

        <h2>What Happens After a Sheriff Sale in New Jersey?</h2>
        <p>
          If the sheriff sale goes forward and the property is sold, several things can happen next:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The winning bidder may eventually take title to the property.</li>
          <li>You may face an eviction process if you still live in the home.</li>
          <li>Your credit and future borrowing ability can be affected for years.</li>
          <li>There may be issues related to any remaining balance (a deficiency).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Understanding what comes after the sale can help you plan — whether that means negotiating more time to move, exploring possible redemption rights,
          or protecting your next housing step.
        </p>
